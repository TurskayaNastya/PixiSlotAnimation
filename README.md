This is a simple slot animation implementation using ES6/2015 and Pixi.js.

## Usage
First of all, this project needs [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) in the global scope:

```js
npm install webpack -g
```

Once we have installed webpack just clone this repository:
```js
git clone https://github.com/TurskayaNastya/PixiSlotAnimation.git

And install it:

```js
npm install
```

Now you can use `npm start` or `npm run dev` to start watching and compiling files.
